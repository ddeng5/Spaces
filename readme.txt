Spaces was conceived at Ram Hacks 2015. Although not fully completed, we won an honourable mention and a "Best Pitch" award.

To check out Spaces, clone this directory and just open the homepage with your web browser. You can be a Spacer (renting out your driveway) or Spacee (renting a driveway) and see all available driveways in Toronto (for presentation purposes).

Due to government regulations about renting driveways/public spaces, this project was discontinued but we will still try to fully complete the project and launch a prototype for fun!!
